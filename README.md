## Setup

Clone or download this repository into any directory.

Run setup.bat or setup.sh to setup all necessary directories

You must compile CXXDecomQt for UNIX systems using cmake. The source code is located in Decom_tools. Otherwise, there is a precompiled image for windows already setup in this repository, also under Decom_tools.

## Running

You can either double click on run.bat (Windows) or run.sh (UNIX), or you can open a shell, change directory to <PATH_TO>/JPSS_tools, and run it by bash, or sh (UNIX), or power shell (Windows).
