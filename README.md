# JPSS_tools

## Setup

Clone or download this repository into any directory.

Run setup.bat or setup.sh to setup all necessary directories

You must compile CXXDecomQt for UNIX systems using cmake. The source code is located in Decom_tools. Otherwise, there is a precompiled image for windows already setup in this repository, also under Decom_tools.


Please read Matlab_tools/Docs/User_Manual.pdf before beginning. This file can also be access by any Doc or Instructions button in the tools.

Place all raw binary data in Decom_tools/data. You can place it elsewhere, but this is the easiest place to place it.


## Running

You can either double click on run.bat (Windows) or run.sh (UNIX), or you can open a shell, change directory to <PATH_TO>/JPSS_tools, and run it by bash, or sh (UNIX), or power shell (Windows).
